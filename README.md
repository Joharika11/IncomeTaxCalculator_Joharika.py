# IncomeTaxCalculator_Joharika.py
This Python program is a simple income tax calculator for Indian nationals based on their annual gross salary. 
The program calculates the tax amount to be paid according to the latest income tax slabs and rules applicable in India as per FY 2022-2023,specifically for the New Regime.
However this not the exact income tax of an individual as I have excluded other things such as the health,food bills etc...

## Approach

- User Input: The program takes the input from the user and then considers an amount of RS.50,000 as rebate and the taxable income will be taken into consideration(i.e;annual_gross_salary - 50,000)

- Tax calculating Logic: The program uses the latest income tax slabs for individuals.

- Output: The calculated tax is displayed in a formatted manner, and the different amounts of tax calculated at each slab rate are shown as well.

- Debugging : The program has been tested with various inputs to ensure accuracy in tax calculation.
